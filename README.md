## Common Git commands

1. git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a .git subdirectory to store repository data.
2. git clone [repository_url]: Clones an existing repository from a remote server to create a local copy on your computer. It automatically sets up a remote named "origin" pointing back to the original repository.
3. git add [file(s)]: Adds file changes to the staging area in preparation for committing. This command stages changes to be included in the next commit.
4. git commit -m "[commit_message]": Records staged changes to the repository, creating a new commit with a message describing the changes. The -m flag allows you to specify the commit message inline.
5. git status: Displays the current state of the repository, including any modified, staged, or untracked files. It provides information about which files are staged for the next commit and which files are not being tracked by Git.
6. git clone [repository_url]: Clones an existing repository from a remote server to create a local copy on your computer. It automatically sets up a remote named "origin" pointing back to the original repository.
